# Employee-Managment-System

# Stephanie Johansson

#### This weeks project was to create a command line application using NodeJS. A user should have the ability to scroll through an employee roster and either chose to view all employees within a department, view salaries, view roles or add an employee to the database. MySQLWorkBench was utilized as our database in this project.
